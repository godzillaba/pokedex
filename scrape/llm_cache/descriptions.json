  "/wiki/Rock_pocket_mouse": "A nocturnal desert dweller that has evolved a striking example of adaptive melanism, with dark-colored populations perfectly matching black volcanic rock formations while lighter cousins blend seamlessly into tan desert stone. The same dark coat has evolved independently in separate populations through entirely different genetic mutations, a remarkable case of convergent evolution.",
