Once thought absent from North America, recent sightings suggest they may be secret regulars along Alaska's western coast.",
  "/wiki/Common_scoter": "Dives in tightly packed flocks for molluscs and crustaceans, with birds synchronizing their takeoffs and dives. In 19th century France, the Roman Catholic Church bizarrely accepted this sea duck as a fish substitute during Friday fasting, exploiting its fishy flavor. A previously unknown wintering population of 50,000+ birds was discovered as recently as 2003 during a wind farm survey.",
  "/wiki/Black_scoter": "This bulky sea duck nests later than almost any other North American duck, laying eggs that weigh 8% of the female's body weight. Forms tightly packed flocks in winter that take off together in dramatic synchronized flights. Males perform a distinctive downward head movement when stretching their wings.",
  "/wiki/Long-tailed_duck": "Uses its wings like underwater oars to plunge an astonishing 480 feet below the surface\u2014deeper than any other duck. Males yodel a musical call that echoes across Arctic tundra, while millions gather in the Baltic Sea for one of Earth's greatest waterfowl spectacles.",
  "/wiki/Bufflehead": "This pint-sized duck has evolved to fit perfectly into woodpecker holes, making it one of the world's most punctual migrants, arriving on wintering grounds within a remarkably narrow time window each year. Males sport an inflatable head that puffs out dramatically, creating the distinctive \"buffalo head\" that inspired its name. Diving almost continuously to fuel its hyperactive metabolism, it rivals the green-winged teal as America's smallest duck.",
  "/wiki/Common_goldeneye": "Named for its striking golden-yellow eyes, this aggressive diving duck nests in tree cavities made by woodpeckers and performs elaborate courtship displays. Mothers sometimes competitively kill the young of rival females, while their own ducklings can take flight after just two months.",
  "/wiki/Barrow's_goldeneye": "Named after Sir John Barrow, this sea duck shows remarkable pair loyalty, reuniting with its mate at wintering grounds even after months apart during summer molting. Females return to the exact same nesting sites year after year, often using tree cavities in mature forests. Its fast-beating wings create a distinctive low whistle during flight.",
  "/wiki/Smew": "The drake's striking 'cracked ice' plumage pattern makes it unmistakable among ducks, earning it the nickname 'panda duck.' This diving specialist uses a serrated, hooked bill to snatch fish underwater. Breeding in Siberian forests, only vagrants ever reach North American shores, making any sighting extraordinary.",
  "/wiki/Hooded_merganser": "Males sport a spectacular fan-shaped crest with bold white patches that they raise during courtship displays. This diving hunter uses its sawbill to catch fish while submerged, relying almost entirely on vision to locate prey. North America's only native merganser, it nests exclusively in tree cavities and will abandon its mate immediately after egg-laying is complete."
