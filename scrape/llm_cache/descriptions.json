Hermaphroditic and equipped with unique dual reproductive systems, it's more commonly caught as bycatch than tuna in some Pacific fisheries.",
  "/wiki/Louvar": "This bizarre oceanic wanderer sheds its teeth, pelvic fins, and tail spines as it matures, transforming from a surgeonfish-like juvenile into a bulbous-headed giant. Despite reaching 200 cm and 330 pounds, it feeds exclusively on jellyfish and other gelatinous drifters. So rare it's almost never seen in fish markets, and when it is, it's quickly removed due to heavy parasite loads.",
  "/wiki/Luminous_hake": "Living 400-500 meters beneath the surface, this silver fish illuminates the deep with distinctive striped light organs running along its head and belly. Its body tapers to a point with no tail fin, and it navigates the pitch-black ocean floor using unusually large eyes on an oversized head.",
  "/wiki/Modoc_sucker": "This tiny bottom-feeder was saved from extinction by installing fences to keep livestock out of its streams. Reaches maturity at just 3 inches long and hides under rocks and debris while grazing on algae and detritus. Once endangered, conservation efforts have been so successful it was downlisted and removed from the Endangered Species List in 2016.",
  "/wiki/Monkeyface_prickleback": "Despite its snake-like body and \"eel\" nickname, this coastal trickster belongs to an entirely different fish order. Adults make the rare switch from carnivore to herbivore, munching red and green algae in rocky hideouts where fishers \"poke pole\" them out with bamboo rods. Native Americans prized its white flesh for centuries, and it can live nearly two decades.",
  "/wiki/Moorish_idol": "Honored with bows by southeast Asian fishermen who release them out of respect, this disc-shaped reef dweller sports a whip-like dorsal fin that resembles a sickle. Named after Moors despite never swimming near Morocco, it's notoriously impossible to keep alive in aquariums\u2014either refusing all food or devouring everything at once.",
  "/wiki/Northern_anchovy": "When Pacific sardines collapsed in the 1940s, this silvery swimmer stepped up to fill American cans, with hauls exploding from 960 tons to 43,000 tons in just seven years. Today most end up as bait or animal feed rather than on dinner plates, despite once being a major commercial fishery.",
  "/wiki/Northern_clingfish": "Clings to the underside of rocks using microscopic hairs similar to a gecko's feet, allowing it to withstand powerful waves in the intertidal zone. Its modified pelvic and pectoral fins form a powerful suction cup that keeps it anchored even in the harshest surf conditions.",
  "/wiki/Northern_sea_robin": "Uses modified pectoral fin rays as legs to walk along the seafloor, kicking up sediment to uncover prey. Sports massive wing-like fins and will bite at practically any bait offered. Its eggs have been used as a budget substitute for caviar.",
  "/wiki/Ocean_perch": "This vivid red deep-sea dweller takes decades to mature and can live an extraordinarily long life, making it vulnerable to overfishing. Males inseminate females months before fertilization actually occurs, with larvae not emerging until spring. Despite severe population crashes in some areas, Canadian populations are now booming, creating fierce competition for fishing rights.",
  "/wiki/Oldwife": "This zebra-striped fish earns its peculiar name from the grinding sound it makes when caught, like an old woman muttering complaints. Armed with knife-like dorsal spines rumored to deliver painful venom, its distinctive black-and-white pattern has remained unchanged for 50 million years.",
  "/wiki/Opaleye": "Named for its striking opalescent blue-green eyes, this herbivorous fish grazes on algae like an underwater cow. Some juveniles undergo a dental transformation, switching from three-pointed teeth to simple ones as they mature into kelp-munching adults.",
  "/wiki/Orange_roughy": "Can live over 200 years\u2014longer than any other commercial fish\u2014but doesn't breed until age 20, making it catastrophically vulnerable to overfishing. Its original market name 'slimehead' was so unappetizing that fisheries rebranded it in the 1970s, helping spark a feeding frenzy that crashed multiple populations within decades. Accumulates dangerous levels of mercury in its tissues from centuries of deep-sea living.",
  "/wiki/Orbicular_batfish": "Master mimics as juveniles, floating on their sides to impersonate dead leaves drifting in mangrove waters. These disc-shaped swimmers from the Indo-Pacific have established a mysterious foothold in Florida, likely released from aquariums by unsuspecting owners.",
  "/wiki/Pacific_cod": "A bottom-dwelling giant that travels in massive schools and sports catfish-like whiskers on its lower jaw. Catches exploded from under 1,000 tonnes in 1979 to over 430,000 tonnes by 1995, making it one of the Pacific's most important commercial fish. Recent genetic analysis reveals it's actually the same species as the Greenland cod, spanning from the Yellow Sea to the Arctic.",
  "/wiki/Porbeagle_shark": "A shark that literally runs hot, maintaining body temperature above the freezing waters it hunts. Developing babies survive in the womb by cannibalizing their unviable siblings\u2014a gruesome strategy called oophagy. Commercial fishing collapsed both Atlantic populations within just two decades, proving this apex predator couldn't withstand human pressure.",
  "/wiki/Prickly_shark": "This slow-swimming deep-sea predator is covered in thorn-like spines and performs nightly migrations from offshore depths to shallow canyon waters to hunt. One pregnant female was found carrying 114 embryos\u2014among the largest litters ever recorded for any shark species. Uses suction to capture prey and can tolerate oxygen-poor waters that other sharks cannot survive.",
  "/wiki/Queen_triggerfish": "One of the largest and most aggressive triggerfish, this reef hunter specializes in crunching through sea urchin spines with powerful jaws. Can rapidly change colors to match surroundings or signal mood, and may have inspired the name 'Bay of Pigs' after its Cuban nickname 'cochino.'",
  "/wiki/Quillfish": "Shaped like a bird's feather with an elongated body that's nearly all fin, this translucent oddball may burrow in the seafloor by day and rise to feed at night, drawn to artificial lights. So slender and elongate that juvenile salmon have been found with quillfish nearly as long as themselves in their stomachs. Lacks pelvic fins entirely and has a head that's only 4-7% of its total body length.",
  "/wiki/Rock_gunnel": "Often mistaken for an eel, this slippery coastal fish can survive above the waterline at low tide and even breathe air when necessary. Marked by a distinctive row of dark eye-spots along its back, it splashes noticeably when uncovered on rocky shores and retreats to deeper water in winter to avoid freezing temperatures.",
  "/wiki/Roanoke_bass": "Endemic to just a handful of Atlantic river systems, this red-eyed predator is often mistaken for its cousin the rock bass despite its darker coloring and nearly scaleless cheeks. Males build and fiercely guard nests on gravel substrates, rejecting sandy or muddy bottoms entirely. Now declining due to habitat loss and competition from introduced species that breed with them.",
  "/wiki/Rockweed_gunnel": "A master of camouflage that changes color to match its seaweed home\u2014green among kelp, reddish-brown among rockweed. Can survive up to 20 hours out of water by breathing air, making it perfectly adapted to the harsh intertidal zone where most fish would suffocate.",
  "/wiki/Rough_scad": "Young fish hide beneath jellyfish umbrellas for protection, using the venomous tentacles as a living shield against predators. Feeds on a precise circadian schedule, hunting only at specific times in the afternoon and night. Groupers have learned to follow jellyfish and wait patiently for these scads to emerge from their stinging sanctuary.",
  "/wiki/Sarcastic_fringehead": "When two males clash over territory, they press their gaping mouths together in an aggressive \"kiss\" until one manages to bite the other's head, determining dominance. This scrappy fish makes its home in anything from shells to discarded soda cans on the ocean floor.",
  "/wiki/Sargassum_fish": "A master of disguise that can expand its mouth to swallow prey larger than itself in a fraction of a second. Uses a fleshy lure dangling from its head to fish for victims, and can grip seaweed with hand-like pectoral fins while stalking through its floating forest home. So voracious that one individual was found with 16 juveniles of its own species in its stomach.",
  "/wiki/Shortnose_sucker": "Sacred to the Klamath Tribes who call it Qapdo, this long-lived sucker can reach 33 years of age in the cold waters of Upper Klamath Lake. Once spawned along lakeshores, but now travels to river riffles to lay eggs that hatch after two weeks of incubation.",
  "/wiki/Slimy_mackerel": "A voracious eating machine that enters such intense feeding frenzies it will strike at cigarette butts and bare hooks. After near depletion in 1982, populations off North America rebounded to over 2 million individuals.",
  "/wiki/Snubnose_eel": "This deep-sea scavenger is notorious for its parasitic behavior\u2014two specimens were once found living inside a mako shark's heart, feeding on blood while causing tissue damage. Using powerful jaws and a tiny mouth slit, it can burrow into larger fish through their gills, though most of the time it simply feeds on carcasses on the ocean floor.",
  "/wiki/Staghorn_sculpin": "A master of camouflage that can breathe air when stranded out of water and dramatically change its color to blend in. Armed with wickedly sharp recurved spines on its cheeks, this slender sculpin juggles between saltwater, freshwater, and even hypersaline environments throughout its life.",
  "/wiki/Starry_flounder": "This flatfish breaks its own family's rules\u2014classified as a \"righteye flounder\" but just as likely to have eyes on the left side. Born swimming upright like normal fish, juveniles soon tilt sideways and one eye migrates across their skull as they settle onto the ocean floor. Can venture up rivers as far as 120 km inland, with rough star-shaped scales earning both its common and scientific names.",
  "/wiki/Tidewater_goby": "Males cement sand grains together with mucus to build elaborate breeding burrows, while females aggressively battle each other\u2014tail-slapping and biting\u2014for the chance to mate. This translucent fish barely exceeds 2 inches and may live only a single year, yet has adapted to feast on invasive New Zealand mud snails in some populations.",
  "/wiki/Treefish": "A fiercely territorial ambush predator that guards its rocky crevice home with just its spiny head exposed, decorated in striking yellow with black bars and white polka dots. Lives up to 25 years in the same small territory, emerging at night to hunt invertebrates and smaller fish with remarkable patience.",
  "/wiki/Turbot": "A prized delicacy since Roman times, this disk-shaped flatfish can grow to nearly a meter long and 55 pounds. Its asymmetric body has both eyes on one side, allowing it to lie flat on sandy seafloors while scanning for prey above.",
  "/wiki/Wrymouth": "This ghostly eel-like fish engineers elaborate tunnel networks in the mud, with burrows branching up to 3 inches below the surface and sometimes extending 4 feet above the waterline. Extremely secretive, it spends nearly its entire life hidden in its self-made burrow system, rarely venturing more than a head's length out even at night.",
  "/wiki/Elk": "Males produce eerie bugling calls that echo through mountain valleys during mating season, establishing dominance over rivals. The second-largest deer species sheds massive antlers annually, only to regrow them in velvet-covered bone that hardens into formidable sparring weapons. Their meat is leaner than beef while packing more protein per ounce."
