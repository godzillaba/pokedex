    "description": "This industrious rodent can fell trees with its continuously-growing incisors and construct dams over half a mile long, with the largest known dam discovered via satellite at 2,790 feet\u2014more than twice the width of the Hoover Dam. Nearly hunted to extinction for its waterproof fur, it can remain submerged for up to 15 minutes and stores winter food underwater for months.",

    "description": "Despite its misleading name, this primitive rodent is more closely related to squirrels than true beavers, and is the only living mammal with uniquely angled molar projections that point toward the cheek on upper teeth but toward the tongue below. Unable to concentrate urine and restricted to wet habitats, it forages up to 9 hours daily on ferns and toxic vegetation that would kill other animals.",
