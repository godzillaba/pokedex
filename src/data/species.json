    "description": "One of North America's largest terrestrial salamanders, spending most of its life underground and traveling remarkable distances to return to its exact birthplace to breed. Can turn cannibalistic when food is scarce, and some populations never metamorphose at all, remaining aquatic for their entire lives. Silently carries deadly fungi and viruses that devastate frog populations worldwide, though immune to the diseases themselves.",

A single female can release up to 10,000 eggs in shallow spawning grounds each spring, often fertilized by multiple males simultaneously. Fossils show this resilient species has been sucking up sediments for nearly 2 million years.",

When threatened, it flees in high-speed zigzag patterns and packs venomous tail spines capable of inflicting excruciating wounds. Despite being the most popular stingray in the aquarium trade, most captive specimens mysteriously refuse to feed and die.",

    "description": "Named after a doctor who studied rattlesnake venom, this pit viper shows remarkable size variation across island populations\u2014from giants stretching 54 inches on Angel de la Guarda to dwarfs maxing out at just 25 inches on El Muerto Island. Recent genetic studies have split what was once considered subspecies into distinct species, revealing hidden diversity in the Gulf of California's island rattlesnakes.",

    "description": "A masterful bluffer that flattens its neck like a cobra and plays dead when threatened, but virtually never bites. Its upturned snout makes it an expert burrower, and it's been bred into 52 different color morphs in captivity. Uses rear fangs to inject saliva that breaks down toad toxins, chewing its venomous prey rather than constricting.",

    "description": "Heat-sensing facial pits allow this venomous serpent to hunt warm-blooded prey in total darkness. Northern females may wait up to eight years before reproducing for the first time, one of the longest maturation periods of any North American snake. Its dark tail rings progressively darken with age, ending in a distinctive black base just before the rattle.",
